    <h1>Rules</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome Race Fans!!! Nascar is back so let the fun begin!! Weâ€™ll be doing
      a race pool with 18 participants, in the same style as our Daytona pool.
      The buy in will be $10.
    </p>
    <p>
      To recap the rules, there will be 2 winners to split the pot. The outright
      race winner will take half, and the points winner will take the other
      half. Points will be scored for the top 10 drivers in each stage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stage 1 will be 10 points to the 1st place driver descending to 1 point
      for the 10th place driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stage 2 will be 20 points for the 1st place driver descending by 2 each
      position down to 2 points for the the 10th place driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stage 3 will be 30 points for the 1st place driver descending by 3 each
      position down to 3 points for the the 10th place driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the highest placed legal finisher of the Final Stage and the Race
      will take half the pot and the participant with the highest number of
      points combined for both legal drivers and all three stages will take the
      other half.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a driver not chosen in the draft should win, the points winner will
      take the whole pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will follow NASCAR decisions when it comes to disqualifications, and
      removal of points and wins. If a driver has their points removed it does
      not effect the points total of any other driver.
    </p>
    <p>
      The list of participants will be put into an automatic randomizer for the
      draft order, and sent out before draft time.
    </p>
    <p>
      This will be a snake draft, meaning that the last person to pick will then
      also have the first pick of the next round and the draft order will go
      back through in reverse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Winnings will be paid out 36 hrs after the race ends to allow time for
      NASCAR to set the final race results.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ladies and Gentlemen start your engines, and boogity boogity boogity lets
      goo RACINNN!!!
